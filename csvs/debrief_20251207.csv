Title;Notes
Checklist Discipline – Daily Drill;"Say 'Checklist start / checklist complete' for: Preflight, Run-up, Before-Takeoff, Pre-Maneuver, Before-Landing."
Pre-Maneuver Checklist – Flight Reminder;"Perform before every maneuver: Fuel selector BOTH, Mixture RICH, Carb heat ON, Landing light ON, Clearing turns COMPLETE."
Radio Workflow – ATIS Volume Reset;"After lowering ATIS audio, reset volume immediately."
Radio Workflow – Pre-Load Next Frequency;"Set the next required frequency in STANDBY before flip-flop."
Departure Discipline – No Talking;"No talking during takeoff roll and initial climb until Tower hands you to Departure."
Heading Bug – Before Maneuver;"Bug intended heading before steep turns, slow flight, or climbs/descents."
ABCD Engine Failure – 10-Second Flow;"Airspeed → Best Field → Checklist → Declare. Goal: complete flow in ≤ 10 seconds."
Engine Failure Restart Flow Memorization;"Carb heat ON → Fuel selector BOTH → Mixture RICH → Throttle ¼ → Primer IN/LOCKED → Mags BOTH."
Carb Heat Idle Check;"Perform carb heat idle RPM drop test during run-up."
Landing – Smooth Power;"Practice holding constant, relaxed power inputs on approach."
Landing – 'Plane in Your Hands' Mindset;"Commit to decisions. Reduce over-corrections. Eyes far down runway."
Visual Flying Partial Panel;"Continue practicing reference to horizon for control without attitude indicator."
Slow Flight Efficiency;"Aim to enter slow flight within 20 seconds step-by-step."
Steep Turns – Altitude Discipline;"Maintain ±100 ft, roll-out on bugged heading ±10°."
Pattern Visualization – Daily;"Visualize downwind → base → final. Eyes far, pitch picture, flare timing."
Take-Me-Back Scenario Practice;"Simulate 10SM inbound call, pattern entry, and frequency planning."
Relax Hands on Controls;"Grip: 2–3 fingers, relaxed wrist, no stiffness."
